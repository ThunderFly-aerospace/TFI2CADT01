# TFI2CADT01 Testing

## Automatic Testing (Recommended)
The process for automatic testing will check the translated I2C device address itself and evaluate whether it is correct or not. This involves a Jupyter notebook that must be run locally on a computer that has access to the SMBUS bus from the kernel. Instructions and a guide for use are written directly in the notebook. The test requires one additional I2C device (which contains a single I2C address).

The notebook is located in [sw/pymlab/TFI2CADT_TEST.ipynb](sw/pymlab/TFI2CADT_TEST.ipynb)

## Basic (Manual) Testing
Basic testing of TFI2CADT01 after its production can be conducted in combination with TFRPM01 using a python[script](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFRPM01/blob/TFRPM01C/sw/pymlab/TFRPM_readout.py) built on the [PyMLAB](https://github.com/MLAB-project/pymlab) library.

The script from the `/sw/pymlab/`directory can be executed using the following command:

```
sudo python3 TFRPM_readout.py 0 0x25
sudo python3 TFRPM_readout.py 0 0x58
```

After the successful launch, measured values should appear. Now, using some probe or by grounding the signal pin, simulate the reading signal. The `count` value should increase. For a more precise measurement, a signal generated by an oscilloscope or another source of a sawtooth signal can be used.

The output may then look as follows:

```bash

The first column represents the time. This is followed by the number of detected signals, the determined frequency, and the time over which the frequency is calculated.
